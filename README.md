This repository contains the Rmd script, written for producing the figures in the manuscript 'Connectivity of terrestrial deep biosphere microbial biomes with surface communities', written by: George Westmeijer, Maliheh Mehrshad, Stephanie Turner, Linda Alakangas, Varvara Sachpazidou, Carina Bunse, Jarone Pinhassi, Marcelo Ketzer, Mats Åström, Stefan Bertilsson, & Mark Dopson. The R script relies on the ASV-table ('seqtab.tsv'), the taxonomy table ('taxa.tsv') and the sample metadata ('smd.tsv'). Additional data files are the number of reads per sample throughout the bioinformatic pipeline ('data_s1.tsv').
