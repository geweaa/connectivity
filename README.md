This repository contains the R Markdown, written for producing the figures in the manuscript 'Connectivity of terrestrial deep biosphere microbial biomes with surface communities'. The R script uses the ASV-table ('seqtab.tsv'), the taxonomy table ('taxa.tsv') and the sample metadata ('smd.tsv'). Additional data files are the number of reads per sample throughout the bioinformatic pipeline ('data_s1.tsv').
