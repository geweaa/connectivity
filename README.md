This repository contains the R Markdown, written for producing the figures in the manuscript 'Connectivity of Fennoscandian Shield terrestrial deep biosphere microbiomes with surface communities'. The R script requires the ASV-table ('seqtab.tsv'), the taxonomy table ('taxa.tsv'), sample metadata ('smd.tsv') and chemistry data ('chemistry.tsv').
